# Horiseon's Code Refactor

### Welcome to my first coding project.

This project features an assignment that mimics an on-the-job ticket.

Our client, Horiseon, had a mostly-functional, visually appealing website that did not quite meet accessiblity standards. As a marketing agency, they needed a functional codebase that met accessibility standards so that they could be found through search engine optimization. They also wanted to reach a larger audience of people by improving their site's accessibility functions.

When first looking at the codebase I was given, I found that the site was full of "div soup". There were many meaningless sections, as well as repetitive CSS style sections. Going through the code methodically, I made sure that each section was labeled in a way that search engines could understand and read the site's content as well as an end-user. I also added many accesibility functions, such as alt attributes in the image tags and increased color contrast in the title of the page.

Through the process of refactoring this code, I learned that altering one section of HTML can vastly affect your site, even breaking it at times. It is important to structure your elements and CSS in a consise and easy-to-understand way.

Although the site still looks the same visually, the code has changed drastically throughout the course of this project. It helped me appreciate that creating readable code from the start will save many programmers time and energy when they, too, have to read my code later down the line. Implementing things like reusable classes, and comments for readability makes the difference.

## Usage and Features

This is how the main page appears to users.

## Suggestion Box

In the future, I would like to add the following improvements:

- This page is currently only built with static HTML and CSS. Adding flexbox or grid to the page would make it much more accessible and dynamic for people viewing the site on different device sizes.

I'm a big believer in always refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach me at the following links.
